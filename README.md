# LG-Ultrafine-Brightness 2

A tool to adjust brightness of LG Ultrafine 4k/5K on **Windows** without the help of Bootcamp.

The program simply send set feature report to the device via USB and then the LG 4/5K monitor adjust the brightness upon receiving such reports.

This project is derived from [https://github.com/csujedihy/LG-Ultrafine-Brightness](https://github.com/csujedihy/LG-Ultrafine-Brightness) which is derived from [https://github.com/unknownzerx/lguf-brightness](https://github.com/unknownzerx/lguf-brightness).

Thanks @csujedihy, @unknownzerx.

The original tool was unable to with simple option or hotkey activation, so here it is.
